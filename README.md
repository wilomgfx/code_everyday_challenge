# Code everyday, create everyday, get better at anything everyday ðŸŽ‰
Just a small challenge to keep my brain active and to learn/create new things everyday!

# I will be doing one project per week, finished or unfinished ! 
1. The goal is to learn new things and learning new things means failing and improve uppon.
I probably wont be finsihing all the projects i aim to do, but i won't feel ashamed :D
2. Commit everyday, even if its small and buggy!
3. Stay motivated and apply things learned at school & elsewhere
4. Contribute to OSS ?
